This post will be mostly documentation for myself, but I also want to share with the world my setup for my personal media server.

## Preparation

The inventory for this project is as follows:

- 1x Bare Metal Server in Frankfurt
- 1x VPS in Ukraine

My goal is to run the VPS as a 24/7 torrent box, and the baremetal server will then be the plex / storage server.

For torrents themselves, I plan to continue to use qBittorrent, with which I've had good experience with in the past.

For managing TV shows I'm partial to Sickrage / <ScreenshotLink text="Sickchill" url="https://github.com/sickchill/sickchill" /> or whichever fork is currently active in the community. For movies I prefer <ScreenshotLink text="Couchpotato" url="https://github.com/CouchPotato/CouchPotatoServer" />, as great as this project is, it is currently unmaintained so if anyone has any suggestions for a project that is at least feature equivalent to Couchpotato that'd be great.

### DNS

Before we get to setting up the servers, lets create some DNS entries and point them at the right host.

I use cloudflare for all my DNS management, but the steps will be similiar for most any provider.

We need to create a few subdomains for the services we are about to setup, the names can obviously be changed, this is just how I like naming things.

Go to your DNS overview, click "Create" and make the following subdomains:

- `qbittorrent.domain.tld` - for qBittorrent
- `couchpotato.domain.tld` - for Couchpotato
- `sickchill.domain.tld` - for Sickchill
- `plex.domain.tld` - for Plex

`qbittorrent`, `couchpotato`, and `sickchill` will all point to our torrent box (rented VPS), and `plex` will point to our bare metal server.

## Server 1

### Prerequisites

Let's get started with the VPS. This is a brand new Ubuntu 20.04 installation, so well begin by updating and installing some necessary packages.

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y vim git net-tools nginx \
  certbot python3-certbot-nginx python2 \
  software-properties-common python-pip-whl
```

</CodeEditor>

Once we have those, we can get started with the tools. This box will need the following:

- [qBittorrent](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent)
- [Couchpotato](https://github.com/CouchPotato/CouchPotatoServer)
- [Sickchill](https://github.com/SickChill/SickChill)

First things first, we'll create a user/group for all of these applications to run under

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo useradd media -g media -u 420 -s /usr/sbin/nologin -Um
```

</CodeEditor>

> This command does a few things for us, first it creates the user `media` with the GUID 420, then it creates a group with the same name, creates a home directory for it at `/home/media` and sets the default shell to `/usr/sbin/nologin` so one cannot login with it - its for application use only.

Next, lets setup some directories for the ongoing and completed downloads:

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/{downloads,media}/{tv,movies}
sudo chown -R media: /opt/media
sudo chown -R media: /opt/downloads
```

</CodeEditor>

Now we can begin installing stuff!

### qBittorrent

There is a version of the headless qBittorrent package in the Ubuntu repos, but its pretty old. So we'll be adding the PPA from qbittorrent themselves.

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:qbittorrent-team/qbittorrent-stable
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y qbittorrent-nox
```

</CodeEditor>

Then we must setup a systemd unit file for this,

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/qbittorrent.service
```

</CodeEditor>

And copy the following contents in:

<CodeEditor>

```bash
[Unit]
Description=qBittorrent Command Line Client
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=media
Group=media
UMask=0002
ExecStart=/usr/bin/qbittorrent-nox -d
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

</CodeEditor>

Close vim, and activate this systemd service.

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable qbittorrent
sudo systemctl start qbittorrent
```

</CodeEditor>

> If you get any errors starting it, you can troubleshoot the systemd process with the following command `sudo journalctl -xeu qbittorrent`

Now qBittorrent should be running on port `8080`.

> You can run `netstat -tlpn` to view all open TCP ports to confirm this.

Finally we need to setup the reverse proxy nginx config for this application.

I like to do the certificate first so I don't have to fiddle around with nginx beforehand. To run certbot in standalone mode though, it needs to spin up its own temporary web server, so we need to stop nginx so the ports aren't blocked.

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d dl.host.tld -d movies.host.tld -d tv.host.tld
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

</CodeEditor>

Now we have certificates for our application(s) domains. Make a note of which folder they got saved in exactly. It is usually under: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/...`, we will need it in the next steps for the nginx config.

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/qbittorrent.conf
```

</CodeEditor>

Copy in the following and make sure to change `qbittorrent.domain.tld` to the domain you chose! This config is relatively simple, we're just reverse proxying port 8080, on which qBittorrent is running, out to the internet under the domain `qbittorrent.domain.tld`.

<CodeEditor>

```bash
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name qbittorrent.domain.tld;

  return 301 https://qbittorrent.domain.tld$request_uri;
}

server {

  listen 443 ssl http2; # managed by Certbot
  server_name qbittorrent.domain.tld;

  location /{
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  }

  error_page 404 /404.html;
  location = /404.html {
    root /var/www/html/404;
    # internal;
  }

  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/qbittorrent.domain.tld/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/qbittorrent.domain.tld/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
  include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}
```

</CodeEditor>

Finally, close vim and run `sudo nginx -t` to lint the config, and `sudo nginx -s reload` to reload the nginx and pick up the new config. Now your qBittorrent instance should be available at the URL of your chosing!

Go to the URL you've chosen and login with the default credentials:

Username: admin  
Password: adminadmin

You should definitely change that first under **Tools** -> **Options** -> **Web UI**.

Then in the **Downloads** tab of the settings, change the **Default Save Path** to: `/opt/media/` and the **Keep incomplete torrents in:** option to: `/opt/downloads`.

Next, close the settings window and in the left hand column menu, right click on **Categories** and select **Add new Category**. Here we will add predefined categories for Movies and TV with their respective default save locations, `/opt/media/movies` and `/opt/media/tv`. Our other applications, couchpotato and sickchill, will add them to qbittorrent with the category applied and then qbittorrent will know where to save the files.

### Sickchill

This application is installed by simply cloning their repo. So we will clone this into `/opt/SickChill` by doing the following

<CodeEditor>

```bash
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/SickChill/SickChill.git
sudo chown -R media: /opt/SickChill
```

</CodeEditor>

Then we can setup a systemd service file for it.

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/sickchill.service
```

</CodeEditor>

And copy the following into it:

<CodeEditor>

```
[Unit]
Description=SickChill Daemon

[Service]
User=media
Group=media
Type=forking
GuessMainPID=no
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python2 /opt/SickChill/SickBeard.py -q --daemon --nolaunch --datadir=/opt/SickChill

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

</CodeEditor>

And don't forget to enable the systemd service.

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable sickchill
sudo systemctl start sickchill
```

</CodeEditor>

> If you get any errors starting it, you can troubleshoot the systemd process with the following command `sudo journalctl -xeu sickchill`

If everything went smoothly, we should have this service running on port `8081` now. Again, you can use `netstat -tlpn` to confirm this.

We now need to setup the nginx config file for sickchill as well. Remember in the previous section for qBittorrent, we used certbot to request a certificate for `sickchill.domain.tld` already, therefore we can skip that step this time and simply apply the preexisting cert here.

So open up a new nginx config

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/sickchill.conf
```

</CodeEditor>

And paste in the following:

<CodeEditor>

```bash
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name sickchill.domain.tld;

  return 301 https://sickchill.domain.tld$request_uri;
}

server {

  listen 443 ssl http2; # managed by Certbot
  server_name sickchill.domain.tld;

  location /{
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8081;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  }

  error_page 404 /404.html;
  location = /404.html {
    root /var/www/html/404;
    # internal;
  }

  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/qbittorrent.domain.tld/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/qbittorrent.domain.tld/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
  include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}

```

</CodeEditor>

> Don't forget to swap out `sickchill.domain.tld` for your chosen sickchill.domain.

Now, visit your chosen URL and login with the default credentials:

Username: sickchill  
Password: sickchill

Again, this should immediately be updated in the options (gear icon top right) under **General**.

While we're in the settings, go to **Search Settings** and select the tab **Torrent Search**.

Here we can create the connection to qBittorrent.

So under **Send torrents to:** select `qBittorrent APIv2`.

**Torrent host:port** should be `localhost:8080`.

**Client username** and **Client password** are the web login credentials you selected when setting up qBittorrent earlier.

And finally, the **Add label to torrent** is the TV category we created in qBittorrent earlier.

After that is all entered, you can select **Test Connection** at the bottom of this form to confirm everything is working.

There are a few other settings you should adjust in Sickchill, but I won't go over them here. They are personal settings such as which torrent provider you want to use, what post processing settings you want like file naming format, etc. You can set this up however you like, just make sure the files are being saved to `/opt/media/tv`!

### Couchpotato

Last, but not least - Couchpotato. This is also simply a matter of cloning their repository:

<CodeEditor>

```bash
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/CouchPotato/CouchPotatoServer.git couchpotato
sudo chown -R media: couchpotato
```

</CodeEditor>

We also have to install `PyOpenSSL`,

<CodeEditor>

```bash
pip install --upgrade pyopenssl
```

</CodeEditor>

> If `pip` is not installed, you can install it via `sudo apt install python3-pip` or manually from pypa.io's script: `cd ~/ && wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py && python get-pip.py`

Next, lets setup a systemd service file for couchpotato as well.

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/couchpotato.service
```

</CodeEditor>

And paste in the following:

<CodeEditor>

```bash
[Unit]
Description=CouchPotato application instance
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/couchpotato/CouchPotato.py
Type=simple
User=media
Group=media
Restart=always
RestartSec=2s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

</CodeEditor>

Then enable it as well.

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable couchpotato
sudo systemctl start couchpotato
sudo systemctl status couchpotato
```

</CodeEditor>

If all went well, you should now also have couchpotato running on port `5050`.

Now we need to setup the nginx config for couchpotato.

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/couchpotato.conf
```

</CodeEditor>

Copy in the following:

<CodeEditor>

```bash
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name couchpotato.domain.tld;

  return 301 https://couchpotato.domain.tld$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl http2; # managed by Certbot
  server_name couchpotato.domain.tld;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5050;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  }

  error_page 404 /404.html;
  location = /404.html {
    root /var/www/html/404;
    # internal;
  }

  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/qbittorrent.domain.tld/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/qbittorrent.domain.tld/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
  include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}
```

</CodeEditor>

Once this is in place, we can let nginx check its configs again and reload it, `sudo nginx -t` and `sudo nginx -s reload`.

Now when we visit our domain, we are greeted with the Couchpotato setup wizard. The most important sections are setting a username / password, and setting up the qBittorrent connection.

Under the section **Downloaders**, check the box next to qBittorrent and enter the following details:

<CodeEditor>

```bash
Host: http://127.0.0.1:8080
Username: selected Username
Password: selected Password
Torrent Label: movies
```

</CodeEditor>

Once that is up and running we can finally take a breather, grab a coffee, maybe a smoke - because we're 90% of the way finished!

We just need to get the media to our bare-metal server now for long-term storage and playback.

## Server 2

This is our bare-metal server which we will use to store the media long-term and run Plex for all our media consumption wants/needs!

So we'll begin by installing Plex. There are many ways to do this, but I'm partial to using a little Github project called [mrworf/plexupdate](https://github.com/mrworf/plexupdate) which is just a bash script to not only automatically install, but also keep up-to-date a Plex installation.

So SSH into your new box, and execute the following:

<CodeEditor>

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrworf/plexupdate/master/extras/installer.sh)"
```

</CodeEditor>

After this is done, you should have Plex running on port `32400` and a systemd unit file called `plexmediaserver`. This means you can stop/restart Plex via `sudo systemctl restart plexmediaserver` or check the status / logs via `sudo journalctl -xeu plexmediaserver`.

Now we'll want to install nginx and certbot on this server as well to grab an SSL cert and reverse proxy Plex out to the internet.

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo apt install -y vim git net-tools nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx software-properties-common python-pip-whl
```

</CodeEditor>

Now we'll grab the SSL certificate for our `plex.domain.tld` domain.

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d plex.domain.tld
```

</CodeEditor>

Then lets create the nginx config file for Plex:

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/plex.conf
```

</CodeEditor>

And paste in the following:

<CodeEditor>

```bash
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name plex.domain.tld;

  return 301 https://plex.domain.tld$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  server_name plex.domain.tld;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:32400;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

    #upgrade to WebSocket protocol when requested
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
  }

  error_page 404 /404.html;
  location = /404.html {
    root /var/www/html/404;
    # internal;
  }

  error_log /var/log/nginx/plex.error.log info;

  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/plex.domain.tld/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/plex.domain.tld/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
  include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}
```

</CodeEditor>

Save and exit vim, and reload nginx to pick up the config file.

<CodeEditor>

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo nginx -s reload
```

</CodeEditor>

Now you can visit your chosen `plex.domain.tld` domain and go through the Plex setup wizard!

### Break

Now lets take a quick break and go over what we've done, and what still needs to be done.

We have our VPS / torrent box running with qBittorrent, Sickchill, and Couchpotato which will be downloading tv and movies. We also have our long-term storage / media player box running Plex from which we can stream all that media.

The only thing missing now is an automated way to get newly downloaded media from one server to the next.

## Media Transfer

I saved this part for last, because this is just a custom bash script I use to run automatically by Sickchill / Couchpotato after downloads are complete and post processing has been run. It just `rsync`'s the media from the one server over to the other.

TO BE CONTINUED...
