I've decided to share my `dotfiles` online, like many others. What is unique here, however, is the implementation details.

Instead of symlinking the dotfiles out of the repo directory to its correct location, I've found a great solution from the [Atlassian Blog](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) which uses Git Bare Repos.

Git bare repos were something I was not previously familiar with, but in this case it allows us to use our home directory (`/home/ndo`) as the git repo directory without committing the entire thing, etc.
