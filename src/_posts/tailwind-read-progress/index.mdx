> Update: CSS is getting a native @scroll-timeline that will make this much easier! See Kevin Powell and Adam Argyle work with it in Chrome Canary [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKfetD9YrA).

It's that time of year again where I decided to rewrite my personal website ðŸŽ‰

This year I decided to grab the tools I love and know best instead of trying something new just because. That stack consists of Next.js and TailwindCSS! I won't go into too much more detail about the rest of the rewrite itself as its a relatively standard blog type portfolio site. But, I did want to share one particular feature I'm very happy to have gotten working with (mostly) just Tailwind and a bit of Javascript!

And that feature is the **read progress bar**! You know the ones, they are fixed to the top of the page and indicate to the user how far they have scrolled through total available page height.

## Implementation

Lets just take a look at the markup and Tailwind classes first.

The important stuff is happening on the first line here. You'll see that all I'm defining is the `bg-gradient-to-r` in order to set the `background-image` to a linear-gradient, and two ring colors. The rest of the classes generate the line itself and keep it fixed to the top of the viewport.

<CodeEditor title="src/components/ProgressBar.tsx">

```jsx
const ProgressBar = () => {
  return (
    <div
      id="scroll-progress"
      className="
        fixed top-0 left-0
        z-50 h-2
        w-full bg-gradient-to-r p-0 ring-pink-300 ring-opacity-75 dark:ring-palevioletred dark:ring-opacity-75 
      "
    />
  )
}

export default ProgressBar
```

</CodeEditor>

Now lets dig into some of the logic.. I'm using [`react-use`](https://github.com/streamich/react-use) for their wonderful set of hooks, in this case we're using `useWindowScroll` to get the current scroll position. I'm also calculating the page height, we'll need this for our calculation later on.

Finally, theres a `useEffect` which has only the `y` window scroll position and `pageHeight` as dependencies. We use these two values to calculate the current `percentScrolled` value to determine how far the user is **down** the page, and therefore how far **across** the progress bar should be!

<CodeEditor title="src/components/ProgressBar.tsx">

```jsx
import { useWindowScroll } from "react-use"
import { useEffect } from "react"

const ProgressBar = () => {
  const { y } = useWindowScroll()
  const pageHeight = document.body.scrollHeight - window.innerHeight

  useEffect(() => {
    const percentScrolled = (Math.abs(y) / pageHeight) * 100
    const el = document.getElementById("scroll-progress")
    ...
  }, [y, pageHeight])
  ...
```

</CodeEditor>

Now we come to the interesting part!

After calculating the percentage scrolled percent, we should be able to just insert that value somewhere and call it a day, right? Wrong.

Tailwind's linear gradients are fairly flexible, but if used as intended, they will generate a fade out affect. We're looking to create a hard stop at the end of the progress bar. I tried to use their built-in `to-transparent`, however it does not contain the critical `0` css gradient stop value, causing the selected color to transition out slowly, as gradients tend to do.. ðŸ˜‚

Fortunately Tailwind makes liberal use of CSS custom properties, and there is one that we can piggy back on and overwrite in order to "fix" the gradient hard stop problem. That's the `tw-gradient-stops` custom property in the `bg-gradient-to-r` class.

```
// bg-gradient-to-r
background-image: linear-gradient(to right, var(--tw-gradient-stops));
```

By setting the `tw-gradient-stops` custom property ourselves, we can set a stop point of the bar to the percentage scrolled, and the second stop to `transparent 0`. This will allow us to achieve the effect of having a sharp edge along the progress bar as it moves across the screen. Our "new" `bg-gradient-to-r` will look like this.

```
// bg-gradient-to-r
background-image: linear-gradient(to right, var(--tw-ring-color) ${percentScrolled}%, transparent 0);
```

Thanks to `useEffect` and the `percentScrolled` string interpolation this percentage scrolled value is updated constantly as the user scrolls, generating our desired progress bar along the top of the screen!

<CodeEditor title="src/components/ProgressBar.tsx">

```jsx
import { useWindowScroll } from "react-use"
import { useEffect } from "react"

const ProgressBar = () => {
  const { y } = useWindowScroll()
  const pageHeight = document.body.scrollHeight - window.innerHeight

  useEffect(() => {
    const percentScrolled = (Math.abs(y) / pageHeight) * 100
    const el = document.getElementById("scroll-progress")
    el?.style.setProperty(
      "--tw-gradient-stops",
      `var(--tw-ring-color) ${percentScrolled}%, transparent 0`
    )
  }, [y, pageHeight])

  return (
    <div
      id="scroll-progress"
      className="
        fixed top-0 left-0
        z-50 h-2
        w-full bg-gradient-to-r p-0 ring-pink-300 ring-opacity-75 dark:ring-palevioletred dark:ring-opacity-75 
      "
    />
  )
}

export default ProgressBar
```

</CodeEditor>

Finally, some of you may be wondering if I'd ever mention those `ring-color`s again, while others have probably figured it out already. The ring colors simply provided an easy Tailwind custom property to hijack in order to be able to define different colors for the bar via Tailwind classes as well. This makes it easy to dynamically adjust the bar's color based on the prefered light/dark theme. We can also fine tune the style of the bar with any of the other ring classes. In this case, I've adjusted the opacity of the bar with the `ring-opacity-75` class.

I hope you've had fun reading this and maybe even learned a thing or two, I know I did working through it!
