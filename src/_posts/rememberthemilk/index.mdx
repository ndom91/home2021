So, like any modern person on the internet today, we all have our own workflows. Our own ways of staying on top of our responsibilities.

One of the key aspects of this, at least for me, is a solid application for notes and reminders.

I've spent a lot of time searching around and trying out different solutions.

The one I've settled on, for now, is called [`Remember the Milk`](https://rememberthemilk.com).

<!--more-->

They have many channels for interacting with your notes, including mobile apps (iOS / Android), Desktop apps (including a client of Linux! [via electron]), a modern web app, as well as a full featured command line client.

This app checks all my boxes:

- [x] Beautiful, modern interface
- [x] Ability to export tasks into neutral format
- [x] Linux Desktop client
- [x] Android Client
- [x] Ability to _very_ quickly add short tasks
- [x] Extensive Keyboard shortcuts
- [x] Commandline client [**BONUS**]
- [x] Google Assistant "client" [**BONUS**]

So I just want to gather all my search operators and shortcuts here so that I may be able to quickly refer back to them here:
