## Introduction

Quick wrap up of how to install HomeAssistant on a fresh RaspberryPi OS (32-bit) install. [Source](https://github.com/home-assistant/supervised-installer)

### Setup

First, setup your OS and update to the newest point by running the following:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Once everything is up to date, we can begin installing prerequisites.

```
add-apt-repository universe
apt-get install -y apparmor-utils apt-transport-https avahi-daemon ca-certificates curl dbus jq network-manager socat software-properties-common
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

Then we have to disable ModemManager

```
systemctl disable ModemManager
apt-get purge modemmanager
```

And finally, we can run the HomeAssistant provided install script for the Docker based installation:

```
curl -sL "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ndom91/0b285844bbe0ed2fff2eb1c8f0c80dd7/raw/48335557bdb71feea110579c86e3148d99f0000a/hassio-supervisor-installer.sh" | bash -s
```

> This is no longer an officially supported install method, but still works great. The above script is a self-hosted version of the official Hassio script they've taken offline.

Once this is run through you will find one lonely docker container, `hassio_supervisor`.

This container will begin pulling and setting up the remaining containers for hassio, including the audio server, dns, etc.

You can watch the progress by running, `sudo docker logs -f hassio_supervisor`.

Once all of the following containers are up and running, you can visit port `8123` on your pi's IP.

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                  COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
8a45e312f9e6        homeassistant/raspberrypi4-homeassistant:landingpage   "/init"                  About a minute ago   Up About a minute                       homeassistant

29cdfbedb566        homeassistant/armv7-hassio-cli:25                      "/init /bin/bash -c …"   3 minutes ago        Up 3 minutes                            hassio_cli
53db8eca79f5        homeassistant/armv7-hassio-audio:14                    "/init"                  4 minutes ago        Up 4 minutes                            hassio_audio
78b26f41aae6        homeassistant/armv7-hassio-dns:9                       "/init coredns -conf…"   5 minutes ago        Up 5 minutes                            hassio_dns
19078153d374        homeassistant/armv7-hassio-supervisor                  "/init"                  7 minutes ago        Up 7 minutes                            hassio_supervisor
```

So in my example, `http://localhost:8123`.

This will bring up the "Preparing Home Assistant" screen. This process actually does take a while, so at this point maybe go have a smoke or make another coffee..

![Welcome Screen](welcome.png)

After the setup is done doing its thing, you will be presented with a User setup form.

Enter your chosen Name, Username, and Password.

Then you will be asked to name your instance, confirm your location, and a few other settings.

Finally you can setup some of the autodetected devices on your network and then you're in!

## Next Steps

At this point I would recommend installing the Hassio Google Drive Backup addon.

Available here: [sabeechen/hassio-google-drive-backup](https://github.com/sabeechen/hassio-google-drive-backup).

To restore a snapshot, login with your Google credentials and download your latest available snapshot.

Finally, `scp` that snapshot onto your pi to `/usr/share/hassio/backup`. You will then find it in the HomeAssistant UI under 'Supervisor' -> 'Snapshots' where you can wipe and restore to that snapshot.

This is some of the hardware I've either already bought or plan on buying. More to come here soon!

When buying hardware, I always try to get things where you don't have to buy an extra "hub" to connect it to your wifi network.
