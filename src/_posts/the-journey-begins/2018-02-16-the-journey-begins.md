Thanks for joining me on this journey. I plan on using this site to document my trials and tribulations in the linux world. Hopefully it can help others who are having similar problems as I am bound to have. Hopefully it can also help future me who will undoubtedly have to refer back to what Iâ€™d initially done to tweak some setting.

Anyway, thanks for coming on enjoy! ðŸ™‚
