I have a relatively fresh Arch Linux install on my new laptop (Huawei Matebook X Pro 2019) and I didn't want to install VirtualBox or anything like that on it again, so I figured now was the time to actually learn out to setup a KVM VM with the underlying tools.

The following is how I went about creating and running a VM with just the command line tools for libvirt, qemu, etc.

## Setup VM

1. Create Disk

First one must create a disk image for the OS to install into. The following command will create a qcow2 image of the size 15GB.

```
sudo qemu-img create -o preallocation=metadata -f qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/test1.qcow2 15G
```

Next we want to start an installation with a given .iso file.

Before I could successfully start an installation, however, it required me to create some sort of networking adapter for the VM.

I decided to go for a simple bridge setup. Notes on creating it can be found [here](https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-create-and-configure-bridge-networking-for-kvm-in-linux/).

2. Start Installation

```
sudo virt-install --virt-type kvm --name ubuntu2010 --ram 2048 \
   --disk /var/lib/libvirt/images/test1.qcow2,format=qcow2 \
   --network bridge=vtbr10 \
   --graphics vnc,listen=0.0.0.0 \
   --os-type=linux --os-variant=ubuntu20.04 \
   --cdrom=/opt/images/ubuntu-20.10-beta-desktop-amd64.iso
```

There are many flags for `virt-install`, so I won't go over all of them here, but you can view its man page either on your system if you have it installed, or online [here](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/virtinst/virt-install.1.en.html)

Finally, these VMs can be started and stopped through `virtmanager`!

Have fun!
